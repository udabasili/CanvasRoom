# CanvasRoom

Building a real-time collaboration tool that allows users to **code together**, **draw together**, and **message each other** using **Node.js** involves several key components. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you could approach building this tool:

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Code Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit code simultaneously, with syntax highlighting and language support.
2. **Real-Time Drawing**: Users can draw on a shared canvas, and all participants see changes instantly.
3. **Real-Time Messaging**: A chat system for users to communicate while coding or drawing.
4. **User Authentication and Session Management**: Allows users to join or create rooms for collaboration.
5. **Persistence (Optional)**: Saving code, drawings, and messages to a database for later retrieval.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React** with **Vite** for a responsive, single-page application (SPA) UI.
  - **WebSockets** (via `Socket.IO`) for real-time communication between clients and server.
  - **CodeMirror** for real-time collaborative code editing with syntax highlighting.
  - **Fabric.js** for real-time drawing capabilities.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js** with **Express.js** for setting up the server.
  - **Socket.IO** for WebSocket communication to handle real-time updates.
  - **MongoDB** (optional) to store user data, messages, drawings, and code snippets.
